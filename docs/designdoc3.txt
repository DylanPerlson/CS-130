CS130 Project 3 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Logistics (7 pts)
-----------------

L1.  [2pts] Enumerate all teammates here.

Aaron Tran, Dylan Perlson, Pieter Van Santvliet

L2.  [2pts] What did each teammate focus on during this project?

Aaron - Invalid references, cell dependencies, cell errors, circular references
Dylan - Moving/copying, cell dependencies, performance improvements, installing linter
Pieter - bug fixes for previous projects, regression tests for previous projects,
linting, create performance tests

L3.  [3pts] Approximately how many hours did each teammate spend on the project?

Everyone spent roughly 30 hours on the project.

Spreadsheet Engine Design (10 pts)
----------------------------------

D1.  [3pts] Moving and copying regions of a sheet are very similar operations,
     with only a few differences between them.  How did your team take advantage
     of the similarity of these two operations to reduce the amount of code
     required to provide this functionality?


D2.  [3pts] Similarly, moving/copying regions of a sheet, and renaming a sheet,
     both involve formula updates.  Was your team able to factor out common
     aspects of these two operations to reduce the amount of code required to
     implement these operations?  If so, what did you do?  If not, why not?


D3.  [4pts] How does your implementation address the challenges of moving or
     copying a region of cells where the source and target regions overlap?


Static Code Analysis / Code Linting (10pts)
-------------------------------------------

L1.  [3pts] What code linter did your team use on your project?  Was this the
     first CS130 project in which you used a linter?

We used pylint, as recommended. We are quite satisfied with the amount of customization
that is supported. We had already looked into the linter previously, but not extensively
used the linter's feedback.

L2.  [3pts] How did you automate the execution of your code linter?  Did
     everyone in your team find it easy to run?

We used the linter within Visual Studio Code. Because of that the whole process is very
smooth (there is an easy tab that lists the outputs of the linter). Since we helped each
other setting up the linter, everyone could easily get started with it.

L3.  [4pts] Did the use of the linter improve your overall code quality and
     correctness?  Give some specific details in your answer.  Were there any
     serious issues you were previously unaware of?

The linter definitely has hugely improved the overall code quality. It has not changed
much about the operation of the code, but the code is significantly more accessible and
clean.

Especially the docstrings for functions made a huge difference: forcing us to describe
what every function does, which is nice for others that want to use that function.

Further, it has made the try: ... except: ... code much better. We were now forced to
think about the different errors that might occur. That made us implement different
strategies of error handling, something we had previously not done. (for example: the
parsing code will now raise specific errors if non-parse errors are encountered,
previously these errors would become cell values.)


Performance Improvement (23 pts)
--------------------------------

In this project you must improve the performance of two central areas of your
spreadsheet engine - cell updating and cycle detection.  In the previous project
your team should have written some performance-testing code in preparation for
this effort, and should have run it under a profiler to get an initial sense of
where improvements can be made.  In this project you need to follow through on
this setup, and address performance issues in your code.

P1.  [9pts] Give a brief overview of 3-4 of the worst hot-spots you identified
     in your performance testing and analysis.  For each one, describe how your
     team was able to resolve it.

1. We found that a lot of time is spent on parsing the formula (this was identified
during the past project). We solved this partially by minimizing the amount of times
parsing is necessary. Now, cells contents are only parsed once, and the parsing-product
is stored for later use. Previously, one unchanging cell could be parsed multiple times
under certain circumstances. This change decreased the execution time of our unit tests
by 30%! :)

2.

P2.  [6pts] Did your team try anything to address performance issues and find
     that it didn't improve things at all?  If so, were you able to identify why
     the intended fix didn't produce the desired benefit?


P3.  [4pts] How do you feel that your performance updates affected your code's
     readability and maintainability?  Elaborate on your answer.

1. This specific improvement slightly decreased readability and maintainability because
it slightly complicated the algorithm, however, this influence was very minor.

2.

P4.  [4pts] Did your performance updates cause any regressions in functionality?
     If so, briefly describe any issues that emerged.  How were these issues
     identified (e.g. automated test failures, manual testing, etc.)?  How
     quickly were issues identified?

1. This fix did not cause any regressions, as indicated by our unit tests.

2.


Section F:  CS130 Project 3 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

F1.  What parts of the assignment did you find highly enjoyable?  Conversely,
     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?

The new functionalities seemed useful but were not necessarily enjoyable.
Linting was quite fun.

F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?

The linting was very useful to learn more about best-practices, as was the
performance testing.

F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)

Fixing earlier bugs was the bulk of how we spent our time. This is of course an
important component of software engineering, but for a course this felt not
particularly useful and unnecessarily tedious.

F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?

More time to fix bugs of earlier projects.
