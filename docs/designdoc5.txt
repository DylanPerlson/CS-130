CS130 Project 5 - Design Document
=================================

Please answer all questions in this design document.  Note that the final
feedback section is optional, and you are not required to answer it if you
don't want to.

Unanswered or incompletely answered questions, or answers that don't actually
match the code/repository, will result in deductions.

Answers don't have to be deeply detailed!  We are mainly looking for an
overview or summary description of how your project works, and your team's
experiences working on this project.

Spreadsheet Engine Design (27 points)
-------------------------------------

D1.  [4pts] Briefly describe the changes you made to the Lark parser grammar to
     support cell-range references.  Can they appear anywhere in expressions, or
     does your grammar constrain them to appear only in particluar contexts?
Cell-ranges only appear in functions. They, as well as expressions, are the inputs
to the functions. Adding them to other parts of the grammar seemed to us to be
risky because they could be wrongly parsed.

D2.  [4pts] How easy or hard was it to incorporate cell-range references into
     formula evaluation?  Elaborate on your answer.
It was medium hard. The cell-range made it necessary to add the cell location to the
output of the cell evaluation (in the transformer). This caused some changes that
had to be implemented in older functions, ie making sure that there would be an
appropriate amount of inputs. This was tedious to implement, but not necessarily
very difficult.

D3.  [4pts] How did you incorporate cell-range references into the cycle-
     detection functionality of your project?  Explain why you chose this design
     over other possible designs; for example, what benefits were you hoping to
     achieve, or what issues were you trying to avoid?

We decided to implement this by evaluating the cells as normal, getting all the required cell values 
before doing the cell range operation like sum or average. The way the program works is that it evaluates a
formula the moment it detects it, and as a result if the evaluated value detects that the original argument 
is attempting to perform an operation on a cell that points to that operation, a circular reference is thrown for both 
the cell with the operation call as well as the cell itself.


D4.  [4pts] Give an overview of the structural aspects (modules, classes, etc.)
     of how you implemented sorting.  Do you sort the rows directly?  Do you
     use proxy objects instead?  Some other technique?

We opted to sort rows directly as our current implementation utilized a helper function 
that would directly translate the sort region's start and end columns and rows in appropriate 
integers, thus making it possible to access the cells of interest directly. No additional modules 
or classes were created.


D5.  [4pts] Give an overview of the behavioral aspects of how you implemented
     sorting.  At a high level, enumerate the steps that your engine goes
     through to sort a region of a spreadsheet.
First the program verifies that all the parameters inputted are valid and throws the appropriate
error if any of them fail to meet the required values. Afterwards, the program goes through and figures out 
the region to sort by translating the start_loc and end_loc into integer rows and columns; if the start location
was further right/down than the end location, the two were swapped before the program proceeds as normal.
From there, the program extracts the columns to be sorted based on sort_cols. Using the cells extracted, their 
individual values are gotten indivudually and a bubble sort is utilized to swap two cells if one of them is "less" or "greater"
than the other. This process proceeds for all cells and all columns left to be sorted before the function concludes.


D6.  [4pts] How does your implementation solve the problem of supporting the
     user-specified row ordering based on both the columns and the ordering to
     sort by?  Did you create any classes or functions to help specifically with
     this task?
After we ensured there were no duplicate columns in sort_cols, whilst we still used the absolute values of 
the columns to get the values themselves, we then double check if the argument was originall negative. If so,
we compare using less than to ensure the smallest values are the farthest down after sorting. Similarly, if there is 
no negative sign, "greater than" is used for the comparator to make sure the rows are sorted smallest to largest.
Once again, no additional classes were created to aid with this process.

D7.  [3pts] Briefly describe the changes you made to your spreadsheet engine to
     satisfy the stricter cell-change notification behaviors.  Did you find this
     to be largely straightforward to change?  Why or why not?
Our prior implementation already appeared to satisfy the "notify once" aspect due to 
how we implemented it in previous projects, and as a result no major revisions were required.
This helped us to focus on other more pertinent aspects ofproject 5.


Performance Improvement (16 pts)
--------------------------------

In this project you must improve the performance of operations that involve
bulk updating of cell formulas and/or values.  In the previous project your
team should have written some performance-testing code in preparation for this
effort, and should have run it under a profiler to get an initial sense of
where improvements can be made.  In this project you need to follow through on
this setup, and address performance issues in your code.

P1.  [6pts] Give a brief overview of 2-3 of the worst hot-spots you identified
     in your performance testing and analysis.  For each one, describe how your
     team was able to resolve it.


P2.  [4pts] Did your team try anything to address performance issues and find
     that it didn't improve things at all?  If so, were you able to identify why
     the intended fix didn't produce the desired benefit?


P3.  [3pts] How do you feel that your performance updates affected your code's
     readability and maintainability?  Elaborate on your answer.


P4.  [3pts] Did your performance updates cause any regressions in functionality?
     If so, briefly describe any issues that emerged.  How were these issues
     identified (e.g. automated test failures, manual testing, etc.)?  How
     quickly were issues identified?



Section F:  CS130 Project 4 Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------------------------------

These questions are OPTIONAL, and you do not need to answer them.  Your grade
will not be affected by answering or not answering them.  Also, your grade will
not be affected by negative feedback - we want to know what went poorly so that
we can improve future versions of the course.

F1.  What parts of the assignment did you find highly enjoyable?  Conversely,
     what parts of the assignment did you find unenjoyable?
The new functions were interesting to implement.

F2.  What parts of the assignment helped you learn more about software
     engineering best-practices, or other useful development skills?
     What parts were not helpful in learning these skills?
At this point, debugging starts being less about learning skills and more
being a chore.

F3.  Were there any parts of the assignment that seemed _unnecessarily_ tedious?
     (Some parts of software development are always tedious, of course.)
Most stuff was tedious, but not unnecessarily so :)

F4.  Do you have any feedback and/or constructive criticism about how this
     project can be made better in future iterations of CS130?
It would be nice if the deadline were not on the last day of the term.
